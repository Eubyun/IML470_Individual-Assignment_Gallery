            <p>Hey, My name is Evy but you can call me Eubyun. I am the third and youngest child in my family. In my household, I was encouraged to pursue my interests, and I've tried many soft skills such as playing music instruments, practicing Chinese calligraphy, drawing, and more.</p>

          <p>Out of all of the things I've tried, I've found drawing to be the most enjoyable and the hobby that I've practiced the longest until today. I've always thought of art as a hobby that I would do just for fun. However, there was a certain point where I wanted to pursue art as a career. Unfortunately, I changed my mind again after being rejected by my dream university. Initially, I was sad, but this event made me think long and hard about my future. I realized that there are various factors that might make me regret going to an art major. But that's a story for another day.</p>

          <p>Now let's talk about the present. I am currently majoring in Library Management (CDIM260) at University Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Puncak Perdana. For one of my courses, which is Introduction to Web Development and Library Portal (IML470), we were assigned to create a website. I decided to use my past drawings as the content for my website, making it a digital Art Gallery of my creations. Although my artwork may be mediocre, I hope that you can still enjoy it as each drawing is important to me because it plays a huge part in my life.</p>
